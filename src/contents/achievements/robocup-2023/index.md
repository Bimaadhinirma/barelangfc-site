POLIBATAM-Barelang FC Team from Batam State Polytechnic was the only Indonesian representative participating in the RoboCup 2023 Humanoid League KidSize Soccer Competition division. Barelang FC and 11 other teams from countries such as England, Japan, Germany, Brazil, Australia, France, South Korea, China, and Canada competed in a 4 vs 4 robot soccer strategy game to claim the title of best robot in the KidSize division.
<br/>
<br/>
In this KidSize division, humanoid robots are built with two legs and play soccer like humans, with robot heights between 40-90 cm. A maximum of four robots can be on the field, with one robot acting as the goalkeeper. The robots must have the ability to detect the ball, dribble, and kick to score goals against the opponent.
<br/>
<br/>
In Round Robin 1, which was divided into three groups, Barelang FC was grouped with Hamburg Bit-Bots from Germany, TH-MOS from China, and ITAndroids from Brazil. The Barelang team successfully won all matches in the group and managed to score 13 goals without conceding any from a total of 3 matches. (Won 5-0 vs ITAndroids, Won 4-0 vs TH-MOS, and Won 4-0 vs Hamburg Bit-Bots).
<br/>
<br/>
In Round Robin 2, which was divided into four groups, Barelang FC was grouped with RO:BIT from South Korea and WF Wolves from Germany. In this session, Barelang again proved their class by winning all matches, scoring 14 goals and conceding only 1 goal. (Won 10-0 vs WF Wolves and Won 4-1 vs RO:BIT)
<br/>
<br/>
After advancing from the group stage, Barelang competed against ITAndroids in the quarterfinals and successfully defeated the Brazilian team with a final score of 10-0. The team's journey continued to the semifinals against CIT Brains from Japan. Playing without a goalkeeper for Barelang FC, the CIT Brains team from the land of the samurai managed to halt the team's progress with a score of 0-10 and sent Barelang to the third-place match.
<br/>
<br/>
Barelang met TH-MOS from China again in the third-place match. In this game, Barelang FC successfully defeated the TH-MOS team from China with a score of 7-0 and earned Third Place in the KidSize Soccer Competition division at the Humanoid League RoboCup 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
The team's journey was not without challenges. The journey from Indonesia to Parc des Expositions in Bordeaux, where the competition was held, took a total travel time of 48 hours. The journey began from Batam, Indonesia, taking a ferry to Singapore on Sunday (2/7/2023) at 5:00 PM. The team spent the night at Changi Airport to fly to Paris via Doha on Monday (3/7/2023) at 10:00 AM local time. Upon arrival in Paris on Tuesday, the team traveled to Bordeaux by train and went directly to the venue to set up the robots and prepare their pit stop.
<br/>
<br/>
"Barelang FC itself is one of the products of project-based learning or better known as PBL. This PBL is one of the CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) based curricula that has been applied to the learning of Applied Bachelor students in Robotics Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering programs who are involved in robot research and development in the Barelang FC team," explained Wibisana.
<br/>
<br/>
The team, guided by Mr. Eko Rudiawan and consisting of 10 students from Electrical Engineering (Salman Alfarisi, Adimas Ariefrahman, Yeni Aryani, Dimas Rizky Saputra, Andi Ninoi Kazuyuki Darusman, Yohanes Hasintongan Manullang, Abdillah Fikri, Iman Rofiq Syamsul, Leo Chandra Yulianto, Aldi Wahyudi), had just completed the KRI 2023 National level competition and returned to Batam on June 26, 2023. Even during the KRI 2023 competition in Semarang, the team had to travel back and forth to Jakarta for VISA interviews for RoboCup 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
"In the end, the team's efforts paid off by achieving the third podium as one of the best robots worldwide at the RoboCup 2023 competition," Turu Eko said.
<br/>
<br/>
We, the entire academic community of Polibatam campus, congratulate the impressive achievement of the Polibatam Robot team at RoboCup 2023 Humanoid League KidSize Soccer Competition division and for bringing honor to Indonesia at the International level.
