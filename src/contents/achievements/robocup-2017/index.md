At RoboCup 2017 held in Nagoya, Japan, the Barelang FC robotics team from Batam State Polytechnic (Polibatam) achieved fourth place in the humanoid robot soccer competition, Kid-Size division. Although they did not secure a podium finish, this achievement marked a significant milestone in the teamâ€™s journey on the international stage.
<br/>
<br/>
The competition brought together robotics teams from various countries with exceptional expertise. For Barelang FC, this was their debut at RoboCup, providing invaluable experience in facing global challenges and competition. Under the guidance of prominent Polibatam lecturers such as Hedawan, Susanto, and five other faculty members, the team successfully developed five robots entirely based on student research and innovation at the Polibatam Robotics Laboratory.

<br/>
Securing fourth place at RoboCup 2017 demonstrated Indonesia's immense potential in the field of robotics technology. While not yet on the podium, this accomplishment served as a stepping stone that inspired the team to strive for greater achievements in the future. This was evident the following year when Barelang FC won third place at RoboCup 2018, further solidifying Polibatam's reputation on the international stage.
<br/>
<br/>
The experience at RoboCup 2017 opened many eyes to the importance of advancing robotics research and technology in Indonesia, while also motivating the younger generation to engage more deeply in science and technology. This success also proved that with dedication and hard work, Indonesian robotics teams can compete at the global level.
