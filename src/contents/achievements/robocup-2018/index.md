The Barelang FC team from Batam State Polytechnic (Polibatam) achieved third place in the international robot competition (RoboCup 2018) for the KID-Size division, organized by the RoboCup Committee from June 16â€“22, 2018, in Montreal, Canada. This division features humanoid soccer-playing robots. This achievement marks Indonesia's first-ever success in this category since participating in this prestigious international event 18 years ago. For the Polibatam robot team, this year's accomplishment is a step up from their performance in 2017 in Nagoya, Japan.

<br/>
The Barelang FC team represented Indonesia in the KID-Size division after winning first place at the National Championship held at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Bandung. The Indonesian delegation for this competition consisted of six students, two faculty advisors, one Polibatam management representative, and one representative from the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.

<br/>
The five robots deployed by Barelang FC in this competition were the result of research and development by Hanjaya, Gobar, Akbar, Andre, Febri, and Joni, under the guidance of Eko Rudiawan, Hedawan, and Susanto, faculty members of the Electrical Engineering Department at Polibatam. The research and development of these robots were conducted entirely in the Robotics Laboratory of Polibatam.
